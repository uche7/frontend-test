Steps to Build and Run the App

1. Clone or Download the Repository
   Clone the appâ€™s repository from a source like GitHub:
   git clone <https://github.com/uche7/frontend-test>

Navigate into the project directory:
cd <frontend-test>

2. Install Dependencies
   Use your package manager (npm or yarn) to install the required packages:
   npm install or yarn install

3. Start the Development Server
   Run the development server to view your app locally:
   npm start, npm run dev or yarn start

Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:3000

4. Build the Application for Production
   Create a production build:
   npm run build or yarn build
   This generates optimized static files in the build directory.

5. Access the app at:
   http://localhost:3000
